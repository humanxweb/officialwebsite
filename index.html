      <h1>HumanX Lab at Dartmouth</h1>
      <p>
        The HumanX Lab for Cognitive Performance and Longevity is part of Dartmouth
        College’s Cluster for Improving Healthcare Outcomes through Sensory Technology
        <a href="https://provost.dartmouth.edu/what-we-do/faculty-affairs/academic-clusters" target="_blank">(Academic Clusters)</a>. 
        This Cluster unites Arts & Sciences, the Geisel School of Medicine,
        the Thayer School of Engineering, and the Tuck School of Business to design, validate,
        and translate sensory technologies that improve care. Its mission is to empower patients
        with personalized health insights and interventions and to enable caregivers from
        families to clinicians to provide better support. <br>
        The HumanX Lab was founded in 2024, when Professor Tam Vu joined Dartmouth as
        the Thomas A. and Georgina Tugwell Russo 1977 Distinguished Professor and was
        tasked to lead this Academic Cluster. <br>
        Dartmouth has a longstanding legacy in Artificial Intelligence as the birthplace of the
        term “AI” in 1956. HumanX builds on that history to establish Dartmouth leadership in
        AI-powered wearables, sensory systems, and digital health innovation, with a focus on
        longevity technologies and rural health. <br>
        HumanX Lab is an interdisciplinary R&D lab advancing wearable and AI systems to
        improve healthcare outcomes, extend longevity, and elevate human performance. From
        body and ambient sensors to edge-AI platforms, we invent and build the
        next-generation devices and AI platforms that integrate seamlessly into daily life and
        health systems, enabling scalable prevention and personalized therapy. <br>

    <!-- Our Vision -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We design, build, and validate technologies that empower individuals to optimize
        cognitive performance, health, and longevity. By advancing adaptive computing,
        automated data collection, standardized cognitive metrics, personalized AI agents,
        non-pharmaceutical cognitive switches, and ultra-eﬃcient edge computing, we create
        solutions that are both scientifically rigorous and practically impactful. Our ultimate
        goal is to establish a future where people can understand, influence, and enhance their
        cognitive functions with accessible, trustworthy, and life-changing technologies.
