        <h2>Dr. Tam Vu</h2>
        <h4>Thomas A. and Georgina Tugwell Russo 1977 Distinguished Professor, <br>Dartmouth College</h4>
        <p>
            Dr. Vu is the Founder and Chairman of Earable Neuroscience. Prior to Dartmouth, Dr. Vu was an Associate Professor at Oxford University and the University of Colorado. <br><br>
            Dr. Vu is a pioneer in Earable Computing. He introduced the term "Earable Systems", describing ear-based sensing and stimulation computing systems. These systems use the ear's proximity to key physiological signals—such as brain activity, eye movements, and facial muscles—to capture data with high fidelity and low intrusion. This approach has influenced the technology industry, including companies like Apple and Google, in the development of advanced human-computer interaction and health monitoring tools.

            Rajnish’s research interests lie at the intersection of wearable technologies, AI algorithms, and the cognitive functions of the human brain. His work focuses on developing intelligent systems that quantify and enhance human focus, attention, and cognitive states in real time. By integrating multimodal sensor data, he aims to model the neural and physiological markers underlying different mental and cognitive processes. His research advances next-generation human–AI interaction, digital mental health, and adaptive learning technologies.
